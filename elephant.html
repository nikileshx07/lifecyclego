                <strong>1.Birth and Infancy:</strong>Elephant calves are born after a gestation period of nearly two years, the longest of any land mammal.
              They are immediately socialized by the herd, learning essential survival skills from their mothers and other herd members.<br>
             <strong>2.Juvenile Stage:</strong>Young elephants grow rapidly, reaching significant size within a few years.
They engage in playful interactions with other calves, strengthening social bonds and developing motor skills.<br>
            <strong>3.Adolescence:</strong>As elephants reach adolescence, they begin to develop distinct physical and behavioral characteristics.
Male elephants may form bachelor herds, while females typically remain with their natal herd.<br>
             <strong>4.Adulthood:</strong>Adult elephants are fully grown and physically mature.
Females continue to play a crucial role in raising calves and maintaining the social structure of the herd.
Male elephants may compete for dominance and mating opportunities.<br>
             <strong>Senior Stage:</strong>Older elephants, particularly females, are highly valued within the herd.
They possess extensive knowledge and experience, guiding younger generations and making important decisions.<br>
