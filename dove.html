            <p>A dove's life cycle begins with the laying of two eggs in a simple nest.<br> After incubation, tiny, featherless squabs hatch.<br> These young doves are fed a special "pigeon milk" produced by their parents.<br> Once they are strong enough, they leave the nest and begin to explore their surroundings.<br> As adults, they form pairs and start their own breeding cycle, continuing the generation of new doves.
