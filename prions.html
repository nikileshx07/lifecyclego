            <p>The prion life cycle begins with a normal protein, PrPc, which undergoes a misfolding process, transforming into an abnormal form known as PrPsc. This misfolded protein acts as a template, inducing other normal PrPc proteins to misfold as well. As more and more proteins misfold, they aggregate, forming plaques in the brain. These plaques disrupt the normal function of brain cells, leading to neurodegenerative diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans and mad cow disease in cattle.
