            <p>
                <strong>Fawn Stage:</strong>Birth: Deer give birth to one or more fawns, usually in the spring.
Camouflage: Fawns are born with spotted coats to camouflage them from predators.
Mother's Care: The mother deer nurses and protects her fawns, teaching them essential survival skills.<br>
<strong>Juvenile Stage:</strong>Growth: Fawns grow rapidly, shedding their spotted coats as they mature.
Socialization: They begin to interact with other deer, learning social behaviors and establishing hierarchies.
Food Source: They transition from milk to a diet of plants and grasses.<br>
<strong>Adulthood:</strong>Maturity: Deer reach sexual maturity around 1.5 to 2 years old.
Rutting Season: During the fall, male deer (bucks) compete for dominance and mating rights.
Reproduction: Successful bucks mate with female deer (does), leading to the birth of the next generation of fawns.<br>
<strong>Aging:</strong>Senescence: As deer age, they may experience declining health and reduced fertility.
Vulnerability: Older deer are more susceptible to predation and disease.<br>
