            <p>Protozoan life cycles often involve an alternation between active and dormant stages. In the active stage, known as the trophozoite stage, protozoa feed, grow, and reproduce asexually. When environmental conditions become unfavorable, they can encyst, forming a protective cyst. This cyst stage allows them to survive harsh conditions. When conditions improve, the cyst can excyst, releasing the active trophozoite. Some protozoa may also have complex life cycles involving multiple hosts and different developmental stages.
