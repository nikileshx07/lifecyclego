            <img src="lifecycle/lofalgae.jpg" alt="Life Cycle Of Algae" class="center-image">
            <p>Algae reproduce both sexually and asexually.<br> Asexual reproduction occurs through cell division or spore formation.<br> Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of gametes to form a zygote, which develops into a new organism.<br> The life cycle of algae can vary greatly, with some species having a simple life cycle dominated by a haploid phase, while others exhibit an alternation of generations with both haploid and diploid phases.<br> The specific life cycle depends on the algal group and species.
