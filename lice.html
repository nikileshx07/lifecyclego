                <strong>Egg:</strong> The cycle begins with the female louse laying tiny, oval-shaped eggs called nits. These nits are firmly attached to the hair shaft, typically close to the scalp. They hatch after about 7-10 days.<br>

                <strong>Nymph:</strong> Once hatched, the louse enters the nymph stage. Nymphs are smaller versions of adult lice. They go through three molts, gradually increasing in size. During this stage, they actively feed on blood from the scalp. The nymph stage lasts for about 9-12 days.<br>
                
                <strong>Adult:</strong> After the final molt, the nymph matures into an adult louse. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed and can be either male or female. Female lice can lay up to 10 eggs per day for about 2-3 weeks. Adult lice live for approximately 30 days.<br>
