            <p>A crow's life cycle begins with the laying of several eggs in a sturdy nest.<br> After incubation, young crows, called fledglings, hatch.<br> They are cared for by their parents, learning to fly and forage.<br> Once they are independent, they join a flock and establish their own territories.<br> As adults, they form pairs, build nests, and raise their own young, continuing the cycle.
