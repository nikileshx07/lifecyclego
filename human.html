            <p>The human life cycle begins with conception, where a sperm fertilizes an egg. The fertilized egg develops into an embryo and then a fetus, growing inside the mother's womb for about nine months. After birth, the newborn infant grows rapidly, learning to crawl, walk, and talk. As children grow, they develop physically, mentally, and emotionally. They transition into adolescence, marked by puberty and the development of secondary sex characteristics. Adulthood follows, a period of maturity, work, and often parenthood. Eventually, individuals reach old age, a time of decline and eventual death, completing the cycle of human life.
