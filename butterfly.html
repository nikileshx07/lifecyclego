                <strong> Egg:</strong> The female butterfly lays eggs on plant leaves.<br>
               <strong>Larva (Caterpillar):</strong> The egg hatches into a caterpillar, which eats leaves and grows rapidly, shedding its skin several times.<br>
               <strong>Pupa (Chrysalis): </strong>The caterpillar forms a protective shell, called a chrysalis, where it undergoes metamorphosis.<br>
               <strong>Adult (Butterfly):</strong> After metamorphosis, the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, dries its wings, and takes flight to reproduce.<br>
