            <p>The life cycle of a hibiscus plant begins with a seed germinating into a seedling. The seedling grows into a mature plant with lush green leaves. During the flowering season, beautiful, vibrant flowers bloom. After pollination and fertilization, the flowers develop into seed pods. These seed pods mature and eventually release seeds, completing the cycle.
