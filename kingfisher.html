            <p>A kingfisher's life cycle begins with the laying of eggs in a burrow or nest hole. After a period of incubation, tiny, blind hatchlings emerge. These young birds are entirely dependent on their parents, who feed them until they are ready to leave the nest. As they grow, they develop feathers and learn to fly. Once they are strong enough, the young kingfishers venture out on their own, though they may still return to their parents' territory for some time. As adults, they establish their own territories, find mates, and raise their own young, continuing the cycle.
