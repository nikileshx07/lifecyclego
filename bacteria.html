            <p>Bacteria, tiny organisms, reproduce rapidly through binary fission.<br> A single cell divides into two, then four, and so on, exponentially increasing in number.<br> Under ideal conditions, they can form colonies within hours. However, unfavorable conditions can halt their growth or lead to their death. <br>This rapid reproduction and adaptability make bacteria both beneficial and harmful to various ecosystems and human life.
