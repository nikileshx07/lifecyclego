                <strong>Egg:</strong>
                Female fish lay eggs in water, often in nests or on surfaces, depending on the species.
                Eggs are fertilized by male fish, either externally or internally.<br>

                <strong>Larva:</strong>
                After hatching, the fish is a larva (often called a fry), which may have a yolk sac to provide nutrients.
                Larvae begin to swim and search for food once the yolk sac is absorbed.<br>
                <strong>Juvenile:</strong>

                As the fish grows, it becomes a juvenile, resembling an adult but smaller.
                Juveniles continue to develop and grow through feeding.<br>
                <strong> Adult:</strong>

                The fish reaches maturity and becomes capable of reproduction.
                Adults lay eggs to continue the cycle.<br>
