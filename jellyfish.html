1. Adult Medusa:This is the stage we typically think of as a jellyfish.
Adult medusae reproduce sexually by releasing eggs and sperm into the water.
Fertilization occurs externally, and the fertilized eggs develop into...<br>
2. Planula Larva:The fertilized egg develops into a tiny, free-swimming larva called a planula.
Planulae are covered in cilia, tiny hair-like structures that help them swim.
They eventually settle onto a hard surface, such as a rock or the seafloor.<br>
3. Polyp:The planula larva attaches to the surface and transforms into a polyp.
Polyps are small, cylindrical organisms that resemble miniature sea anemones.
They reproduce asexually by budding, producing clones of themselves.<br>
4. Ephyra:Some polyps undergo a process called strobilation, where they release tiny, immature medusae called ephyrae.
Ephyrae are essentially baby jellyfish.<br>
5. Juvenile Medusa:The ephyrae grow and develop into juvenile medusae.<br>
6. Adult Medusa:The juvenile medusae mature into adult medusae, completing the cycle.<br>
