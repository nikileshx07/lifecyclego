            <p>A jasmine plant begins its life cycle as a seed, which germinates into a seedling. The seedling grows into a mature plant with lush green leaves and fragrant flowers. After pollination, the flowers wither, and seed pods form. These pods ripen and release seeds, which can germinate to start a new life cycle.
