                <strong>Eggs:</strong> Frogs start their life as eggs. The female frog lays her eggs in water, usually in a cluster or mass.<br>
                <strong>Tadpole: </strong>After the eggs hatch, they become tadpoles. Tadpoles are little fish-like creatures with a tail and gills, and they live in the water.<br>
                <strong>Tadpole with Legs:</strong> As the tadpole grows, it starts to grow legs. First, the back legs appear, and then the front legs. The tadpole also develops lungs to breathe air.<br>
                <strong>Froglet:</strong> The tadpole's tail shrinks, and it becomes a froglet. The froglet looks like a small frog but still needs to stay near water.<br>
                <strong>Adult Frog:</strong> Finally, the froglet grows into an adult frog. The frog is fully developed with strong legs for jumping, and it can live on land or in water.<br>
