            <p>Marigold life begins with a seed germinating into a seedling. The seedling grows into a bushy plant with vibrant flowers. After pollination, the flowers wither, and seed pods form. These pods mature and release seeds, ready to start a new cycle. Marigolds are often annuals, meaning their life cycle completes within a year.
