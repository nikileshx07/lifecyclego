            <p>From a tiny foal to a majestic stallion, a horse's life unfolds in stages.<br> It begins as a newborn, dependent on its mother for nourishment and protection.<br> As it grows, it learns to stand, walk, and run, exploring the world around it.<br> Reaching adulthood, it develops its full strength and grace, ready to serve humans or roam freely.<br> Finally, as years pass, it enters its senior years, its spirit enduring even as its body shows signs of age.
